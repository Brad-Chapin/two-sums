I attempted to pick apart the necessary process to use TDD for this, but mocha/chai... eluded me, completely. I clearly need more help/practice with using them.

That said, I deemed it a better use of my time to practice my javascript, which I *also* feel isn't where it should be.

Feedbak welcome and encouraged.
